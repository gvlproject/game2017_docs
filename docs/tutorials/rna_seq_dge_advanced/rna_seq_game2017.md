# RNA-Seq Differential Gene Expression Workshop

-----

## Tutorial Overview

In this tutorial we compare the performance of three statistically-based
expression analysis tools:  

- CuffDiff
- EdgeR
- DESeq2

This tutorial builds on top of the [basic RNA-seq DGE tutorial](../rna_seq_dge_basic/rna_seq_basic_tutorial.md).
It is recommended to have some familiarity of RNA-seq before beginning this
tutorial.

-----

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this tutorial you should:

 - Be familiar with multiple workflows for RNA-seq differential expression analysis
 - Be able to process raw RNA sequence data from samples of two conditions into
   a list of differentially expressed genes
 - Be able to compare the results of gene lists generated by different methods

-----

## Background

#### Where does the data in this tutorial come from?
The data for this tutorial is from the paper, *A comprehensive comparison of
RNA-Seq-based transcriptome analysis from reads to differential gene expression
and cross-comparison with microarrays: a case study in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae* by Nookaew et al. [1] which studies S.cerevisiae strain CEN.PK
113-7D (yeast) under two different metabolic conditions: glucose-excess (batch)
or glucose-limited (chemostat).

The RNA-Seq data has been uploaded in NCBI, short read archive (SRA), with
accession SRS307298. There are 6 samples in total-- two treatments with
three biological replicates each. The data is paired-end.  

We have extracted chromosome I reads from the samples to make the
tutorial a suitable length. This has implications for downstream analysis,
as discussed in the optional extension section.

-----

## Section 1: Preparation
#### 1.  Register as a new user in Galaxy if you don’t already have an account
1.  Open a browser and go to a Galaxy server. For this workshop we will be using
    the server at [game-1.genome.edu.au](http://game-1.genome.edu.au/galaxy).
    The public [Galaxy Melbourne server](http://galaxy-mel.genome.edu.au) can
    also be used.
    Recommended browsers include Firefox and Chrome. Internet Explorer
    is not supported.
2.  Register as a new user by clicking **User > Register** on the top
    dark-grey bar. Alternatively, if you already have an account, login by
    clicking **User > Login**.

#### 2.  Import the RNA-seq data for the workshop.
If you are using the public game-1 Galaxy server or Galaxy Melbourne server,
you can import the data directly from Galaxy. You can do this by going to
**Shared Data > Published Histories** on the top toolbar, and selecting
the history called **GAMe2017_RNA-seq_Start**. Then click on "Import History" on
the top right and "start using this history" to switch to the newly imported
history.

\showable{Alternate instructions if you are using your own personal Galaxy server.}{hint}

Alternatively, if you are using your own personal Galaxy server, you can import
the data by:

1.  In the tool panel located on the left, under Basic Tools select **Get
    Data > Upload File**. Click on the **Paste/Fetch data** button on the
    bottom section of the pop-up window.
2.  Upload the sequence data by pasting the following links into the text
    input area.

    </div>

\endshowable

You should now have these 13 files in your history:

- batch1_chrI_1.fastq
- batch1_chrI_2.fastq
- batch2_chrI_1.fastq
- batch2_chrI_2.fastq
- batch3_chrI_1.fastq
- batch3_chrI_2.fastq
- chem1_chrI_1.fastq
- chem1_chrI_2.fastq
- chem2_chrI_1.fastq
- chem2_chrI_2.fastq
- chem3_chrI_1.fastq
- chem3_chrI_2.fastq
- genes.gtf

These files can be renamed by clicking the **pen icon** if you wish.

These 12 sequencing files are in FASTQ format and have the file
extension: .fastq. If you are not familiar with the FASTQ format, [click
here for an overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format).  

**Note:** The reads are paired end; for example batch1_chrI_1.fastq and
batch1_chrI_2.fastq are paired reads from one sequencing run. Low quality
reads have already been trimmed.

Click on the **eye icon** to the top right of a FASTQ file to view the
first part of the file.

The gene annotation file (genes.gtf) is in GTF format. This file describes
where the genes are located in the S. cerevisiae reference genome.
Each feature is defined by a chromosomal start and end point, feature type (CDS, gene, exon etc),
and parent gene and transcript.
More information on the GTF format can be found
[here](http://asia.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html).

-----

## Section 2: Alignment with TopHat

In this section we map the reads in our FASTQ files to a reference genome. As
these reads originate from mRNA, we expect some of them will cross exon/intron
boundaries when we align them to the reference genome. Tophat is a splice-aware
mapper for RNA-seq reads that is based on Bowtie. It uses the mapping results
from Bowtie to identify splice junctions between exons. More information on
Tophat can be found [here](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml).


#### 1.  Map/align the reads with Tophat to the S. cerevisiae reference
In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select
**NGS: RNA Analysis > Tophat** and set the parameters as follows:  

- **Is this single-end or paired-end data?** Paired-end (as individual datasets)  
- **RNA-Seq FASTQ file, forward reads:**  
(Click on the **multiple datasets icon** and select all six of the forward
FASTQ files ending in \*1.fastq. This should be correspond to every
second file (1,3,5,7,9,11). This can be done by holding down the
ctrl key (Windows) or the command key (OSX) to select multiple files.)
    - batch1_chrI_1.fastq
    - batch2_chrI_1.fastq
    - batch3_chrI_1.fastq
    - chem1_chrI_1.fastq
    - chem2_chrI_1.fastq
    - chem3_chrI_1.fastq

- **RNA-Seq FASTQ file, reverse reads:**  
(Click on the **multiple datasets icon** and select all six of the reverse
FASTQ files ending in \*2.fastq.)  
    - batch1_chrI_2.fastq
    - batch2_chrI_2.fastq
    - batch3_chrI_2.fastq
    - chem1_chrI_2.fastq
    - chem2_chrI_2.fastq
    - chem3_chrI_2.fastq
- **Use a built in reference genome or own from your history:** Use
built-in genome
- **Select a reference genome:** S. cerevisiae June 2008 (SGD/SacCer2)
(sacCer2)
- Use defaults for the other fields
- Execute

\showable{Show screenshot}{hint}

\endshowable

Note: This may take a few minutes, depending on how busy the server is.

#### 2.  Rename the output files
You should have 5 output files for each of the FASTQ input files:

- **Tophat on data 2 and data 1: accepted_hits:** This is a BAM file containing
  sequence alignment data of the reads. This file contains the location
  of where the reads mapped to in the reference genome. We will examine
  this file more closely in the next step.
- **Tophat on data 2 and data 1: splice junctions:** This file lists all the places
  where TopHat had to split a read into two pieces to span an exon
  junction.
- **Tophat on data 2 and data 1 deletions** and **Tophat on data 2 and data 1: insertions:**
  These files list small insertions or deletions found in the reads.
  Since we are working with synthetic reads we can ignore Tophat for
  Illumina data 1:insertions Tophat for Illumina data 1:deletions for now.
- **Tophat on data 2 and data 1: align_summary:** This file gives some mapping
  statistics including the number of reads mapped and the mapping rate.

You should have a total of 30 Tophat output files in your history.

Rename the 6 accepted_hits files into a more meaningful name (e.g.
'Tophat on data 2 and data 1: accepted_hits' to 'batch1-accepted_hits.bam')
by using the **pen icon** next to the file.

#### 3.  Visualise the aligned reads with Trackster  
Before we visualise our alignments in Trackster, we need to slightly modify our
GTF file. The genes.gtf file for S. cerevisae (as downloaded from UCSC Table Browser)
has a slightly different naming convention for one of the contigs (2-micron)
than the reference genome used by Galaxy (2micron), which will cause an error to
be thrown by Trackster if you try to add it. This is very typical of
genomics currently! For this tutorial, we can fix this by removing the rows
beginning with '2-micron' since we are only interested in chrI genes anyway.

1.  In the left tool panel menu, under Filter and Sort, select
    **Select lines that match an expression** and set the parameters as follows:
    - **Select lines from:** genes.gtf
    - **that:** Matching
    - **the partern:** `^chrI\t`

The result will be a GTF file only containing the features belonging to chrI.
Rename this file to something like 'chrI_genes.gtf'.

We can now visualise our data in Trackster.

1.  On the top bar of Galaxy, select **Visualization > New Track Browser**.
2.  Name your new visualization and select S. cerevisiae (sacCer2) as the
    reference genome build.
3.  Click the **Add Datasets to Visualization** button and select
    'batch1-accepted_hits.bam', 'chem1-accepted_hits.bam', and 'chrI_genes.gtf'
    by using the checkboxes on the left.
4.  Select chrI from the dropdown box. You can zoom in and out using the
    buttons on the top toolbar. Can you find any genes that look differentially
    expressed between the two BAM files?
5.  You can also add more tracks using the **Add Tracks icon** located on the
    top right. Load one of the splice junction files such as 'Tophat on data 2
    and data 1: splice junctions'.
6.  Explore the data and try to find a splice junction. Next to the
    drop down list, click on the chromosomal position number
    display and specify the location **chrI:86985-87795** to view an
    intron junction.  

Before starting the next section, leave the Trackster interface and return
to the analysis view of Galaxy by clicking 'Analyze Data' on the top
Galaxy toolbar.

-----

## Section 3: Cuffdiff

The aim in this section is to statistically test for differential expression
using Cuffdiff and obtain a list of significant genes.

#### 1.  Run Cuffdiff to identify differentially expressed genes and transcripts

Cuffdiff takes a long time to run (even when using a subset of data) so in this
workshop we'll be importing a history with finished Cuffdiff results.

You can do this by going to **Shared Data > Published Histories** on the top
toolbar, and selecting the history called **GAMe2017_RNA-seq_Cuffdiff**.
Then click on "Import History" on the top right and "start using this history"
to switch to the newly imported history.

\showable{Show Cuffdiff instructions}{hint}

In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select
**NGS: RNA Analysis > Cuffdiff** and set the parameters as follows:

- **Transcripts:** genes.gtf
- **Condition:**  
    - **1: Condition**
        - **name** batch
        - **Replicates:**
            - batch1-accepted_hits.bam
            - batch2-accepted_hits.bam
            - batch3-accepted_hits.bam  
            (Multiple datasets can be selected by holding down the shift key or
            the ctrl key (Windows) or the command key (OSX).)
    - **2: Condition**
        - **name** chem
        - **Replicates:**
            - chem1-accepted_hits.bam
            - chem2-accepted_hits.bam
            - chem3-accepted_hits.bam  
- Use defaults for the other fields
- Execute

Note: This step may take a while, depending on how busy the server is.

\endshowable

\showable{Show screenshot}{hint}

<img src="../media/rna_advanced_cuffdiff.png" height=700px>

\endshowable


#### 2.  Explore the Cuffdiff output files

There should be 11 output files from Cuffdiff. These files should all begin
with something like "Cuffdiff on data 43, data 38, and others".

**FPKM tracking files:**  

- transcript FPKM tracking
- gene FPKM tracking
- TSS groups FPKM tracking
- CDS FPKM tracking  

These 4 files contain the FPKM (a unit of normalised expression taking
into account the transcript length for each transcript
and the library size of the sample) for each of the two conditions.

**Differential expression testing files:**  

- gene differential expression testing
- transcript differential expression testing
- TSS groups differential expression testing
- CDS FPKM differential expression testing
- CDS overloading differential expression testing
- promoters differential expression testing
- splicing differential expression testing

These 7 files contain the statistical
results from testing the level of expression between the two conditions.

1.  Examine the tables of normalised gene counts
    View the Cuffdiff file "Cuffdiff on data x, data x, and others: gene FPKM
    tracking" by clicking on the **eye icon**. The file consists of one row
    for each gene from the reference transcriptome, with columns containing the
    normalised read counts for each of the two conditions.
    Note:  
    - Cuffdiff gives each gene it’s own ‘tracking_id’, which equates
      to a gene. Multiple transcription start sites are aggregated under a
      single tracking_id.
    - A gene encompasses a chromosomal locus which covers all the features
      that make up that gene (exons, introns, 5’ UTR, etc).

2.  Inspect the gene differential expression testing file
    View the Cuffdiff file "Cuffdiff on data x, data x, and others: gene
    differential expression testing" by clicking on the **eye icon**. The
    columns of interest are: gene (c3), locus (c4), log2(fold_change) (c10),
    p_value (c12), q_value (c13) and significant (c14).

3.  Filter based on column 14 (‘significant’) - a binary assessment of
    q_value > 0.05, where q_value is p_value adjusted for multiple testing.
    Under Basic Tools, click on **Filter and Sort > Filter**:
    - **Filter:** "Cuffdiff on data....: gene differential expression testing"
    - **With following condition:** c14=='yes'
    - Execute

    This will keep only those entries that Cuffdiff has marked as
    significantly differentially expressed. There should be 53 differentially
    expressed genes in this list.

We can rename this file by clicking on the **pencil icon** of
the outputted file and change the name from "Filter on data x" to
"Cuffdiff_Significant_DE_Genes".

-----

## Section 4: Another workflow with HISAT2

Now we've seen an example of a RNA-seq workflow using TopHat for alignment and
Cuffdiff for quantification and analysis, we can try another workflow with
more modern software.

Start with a new history by importing the same history as before. Go to
**Shared Data > Published Histories** on the top toolbar, and selecting
the history called **GAMe2017_RNA-seq_Start**. Then click on "Import History" on
the top right and "start using this history" to switch to the newly imported
history.

HISAT2 is a fast alignment program that is a successor to TopHat2. Running
HISAT2 is similar to running TopHat.

In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select
**NGS: RNA Analysis > HISAT2** and set the parameters as follows:  

- **Input data format** FASTQ
- **Single end or paired reads?** Individual paired reads
- **Forward reads:**  
(Click on the **multiple datasets icon** and select all six of the forward
FASTQ files ending in \*1.fastq. This should be correspond to every
second file (1,3,5,7,9,11). This can be done by holding down the
ctrl key (Windows) or the command key (OSX) to select multiple files.)
    - batch1_chrI_1.fastq
    - batch2_chrI_1.fastq
    - batch3_chrI_1.fastq
    - chem1_chrI_1.fastq
    - chem2_chrI_1.fastq
    - chem3_chrI_1.fastq

- **Reverse reads:**  
(Click on the **multiple datasets icon** and select all six of the reverse
FASTQ files ending in \*2.fastq.)  
    - batch1_chrI_2.fastq
    - batch2_chrI_2.fastq
    - batch3_chrI_2.fastq
    - chem1_chrI_2.fastq
    - chem2_chrI_2.fastq
    - chem3_chrI_2.fastq
- **Source for the reference genome to align against:** Use
built-in genome
- **Select a reference genome:** S. cerevisiae June 2008 (SGD/SacCer2)
(sacCer2)
- Use defaults for the other fields
- Execute

HISAT2 outputs one bam file for each set of paired-end read files. Rename the 6
files into a more meaningful name (e.g. 'HISAT on data 2 and data 1' to 'batch1.bam')
by using the **pen icon** next to the file.

-----

## Section 5: Count reads in features

HTSeq-count creates a count matrix using the number of the reads from each bam
file that map to the genomic features in the genes.gtf. For each feature (a
gene for example) a count matrix shows how many reads were mapped to this
feature.

1.  Use HTSeq-count to count the number of reads for each feature.  
    In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select
    **NGS: RNA Analysis > SAM/BAM to count matrix** and set the parameters as follows:  
    - **Gene model (GFF) file to count reads over from your current history:** genes.gtf
    - **bam/sam file from your history:**  
      (Select all six bam files using the shift key.)
        - batch1.bam
        - batch2.bam
        - batch3.bam
        - chem1.bam
        - chem2.bam
        - chem3.bam
    - Use defaults for the other fields
    - Execute

2.  Examine the outputted matrix by using the **eye icon**.  
    Each column corresponds to a sample and each row corresponds to a gene. By
    sight, see if you can find a gene you think is differentially expressed
    from looking at the counts.

We now have a count matrix, with a count against each corresponding sample. We
will use this matrix in later sections to calculate the differentially
expressed genes.

-----

## Section 6: edgeR

[edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)
is an R package, that is used for analysing differential expression of
RNA-Seq data and can either use exact statistical methods or generalised
linear models.

#### 1.  Generate a list of differentially expressed genes using edgeR
In the Galaxy tool panel, under NGS Analysis, select
**NGS: RNA > Differential_Count** and set the parameters as follows:

- **Select an input matrix - rows are contigs, columns are counts for each
  sample:** bams to DGE count matrix_htseqsams2mx.xls
- **Title for job outputs:** Differential_Counts_edgeR
- **Treatment Name:** Batch
- **Select columns containing treatment:**  
    - batch1.bam
    - batch2.bam
    - batch3.bam
- **Control Name:** Chem
- **Select columns containing control:**  
    - chem1.bam
    - chem2.bam
    - chem3.bam
- **Run this model using edgeR:** Run edgeR
- Use defaults for the other fields
- Execute

#### 2.  Examine the outputs from the previous step
1.  Examine the Differential_Counts_edgeR_topTable_edgeR.xls file by
    clicking on the **eye icon**.
    This file is a list of genes sorted by p-value from using EdgeR to
    perform differential expression analysis.
2.  Examine the Differential_Counts_edgeR.html file. This file has some
    output logs and plots from running edgeR. If you are familiar with R,
    you can examine the R code used for analysis by scrolling to the bottom
    of the file, and clicking Differential_Counts.Rscript to download the
    Rscript file.  
    If you are curious about the statistical methods edgeR uses, you can
    read the [edgeR user's guide at
    Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html).

#### 3.  Extract the significant differentially expressed genes.  
Under Basic Tools, click on **Filter and Sort > Filter**:

- **Filter:** "Differential_Counts_edgeR_topTable_edgeR.xls"
- **With following condition:** c6 < 0.05
- Execute

This will keep the genes that have an adjusted p-value of less
than 0.05. There should be 55 genes in this file.
Rename this file by clicking on the **pencil icon** of and change the name
from "Filter on data x" to "edgeR_Significant_DE_Genes".

#### 3. Explore your data

Read through the Degust tour of features. Explore the parallel coordinates plot,
MA plot, MDS plot, heatmap and gene list. Each is fully interactive and
influences other portions on the display depending on what is selected.

<img src="../media/rna_advanced_degust_3.png" height=400px style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;">

On the right side of the page is an options module which can set thresholds to
filter genes using statistical significance or absolute-fold-change.

On the left side is a dropdown box you can specify the method (Voom/Limma or
edgeR) used to perform differential expression analysis on the data. You can
also view the R code by clicking "Show R code" under the options module on
the right.

#### 4. (Optional) Explore the demo data

Degust also provides an example dataset with 4 conditions and more genes. You
can play with the demo dataset by clicking on the "Try the demo" button on the
Degust homepage. The demo dataset includes a column with an EC number for each
gene. This means genes can be displayed on Kegg pathways using the module on
the right.

\showable{More info on PCA plots}{hint}

PCA plots are useful for exploratory data analysis. Samples which are more
similar to each other are expected to cluster together. A count matrix often
has thousands of dimensions (one for each feature) and our PCA plot generated in
the previous step transforms the data so the most variability is represented in principal
components 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2 represented by the x-axis and y-axis respectively).

<img src="../media/rna_advanced_deseq2_pca.png" height=400px>

Take note of the scales on the x-axis and the y-axis. The x-axis representing
the first principal component accounts for 96% of the variance and ranges from
approximately -6 to +6, while the y-axis ranges from approximately -1 to +1.

For both conditions, the 3 replicates tend to be closer to each other than they are to replicates from the other condition.

Additionally, within conditions, the lower glucose (chem) condition shows more
variability between replicates than the higher glucose (batch) condition.

## Section 8: DESeq2 workflow

The workshop instructors will demonstrate how to use DESeq2 for differential
expression analysis.

If you are interested in looking at the outputs, you can view the files by
going to **Shared Data > Published Histories** on the top toolbar, and selecting
the history called **GAMe2017_RNA-seq_DESeq2**. Then click on "Import History" on
the top right and "start using this history" to switch to the newly imported
history.

\showable{DESeq2 steps}{hint}

*Note: These tools may not be installed in Galaxy. You may need to install or
ask an administrator to install htseq-count and DESeq2 via the Galaxy Tool Shed.*

1.  Use HTSeq-count to count the number of reads for each feature and generate
    a count file for each alignment file.  
    In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select **NGS: RNA Analysis
    > htseq-count** and set the parameters as follows:
    - **Aligned SAM/BAM File:**  
      (Select all six bam files using the shift key.)  
        - batch1-accepted_hits.bam
        - batch2-accepted_hits.bam
        - batch3-accepted_hits.bam
        - chem1-accepted_hits.bam
        - chem2-accepted_hits.bam
        - chem3-accepted_hits.bam
    - **Stranded**: No
    - **ID Attribute:** gene_name
    - Use defaults for the other fields
    - Execute

2.  Rename the outputs from htseq-count to sensible names. For example:
    "htseq-count on data 13 and data 18" to "batch1_counts".

3.  Use DESeq2 to find differentially expressed features from count tables.  
    In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select **NGS: RNA Analysis
    > DESeq2** and set the parameters as follows:
    - **1: Factor**
        - **Specify a factor name:** condition
        - **1: Factor level:**
            - **Specify a factor level:** batch  
            (Select the three batch htseq-count files.)
                - batch1_counts
                - batch2_counts
                - batch3_counts
        - **2: Factor level:**
            - **Specify a factor level:** chem  
            (Select the three chem htseq-count files.)
                - chem1_counts
                - chem2_counts
                - chem3_counts

4.  Have a look at the outputs of DESeq2. We will now filter significant
    (adjusted p-value < 0.05) genes from the DESeq2 result file.  
    Under Basic Tools, click on **Filter and Sort > Filter**:
    - **Filter:** "DESeq2 result file on data ..."
    - **With following condition:** c7 < 0.05
    - Execute

There should be 53 genes in this file.
Rename this file by clicking on the **pencil icon** of and change the name
from "Filter on data x" to "DESeq2_Significant_DE_Genes".

## Section 9: How much concordance is there between methods?

We are interested in how similar the identified genes are between the different
statistical methods used by Cuffdiff, edgeR, and DESeq2. We can generate a
Venn diagram to visualise the amount of overlap.

You can download a shared history with all three significant gene lists by going
to **Shared Data > Published Histories** on the top toolbar, and selecting
the history called **GAMe2017_RNA-seq_concordance**. Then click on "Import History" on
the top right and "start using this history" to switch to the newly imported
history.

The output has already been generated in this history, but here are the steps
to generate the Venn diagram if you want to run it yourself:

1.  Generate a Venn diagram of the output of the 3 differential expression tools.  
    Note that column index 2 (or c3) contains the gene name in the Cuffdiff output.
    Similarly column index 0 (or c1) in EdgeR and DESeq2 contain the gene names.  
    In the Galaxy tool panel, under Statistics and Visualisation, select
    **Graph/Display Data > proportional venn** and set the parameters as follows:  
    - **title:** Common genes
    - **input file 1:** Cuffdiff_Significant_DE_Genes
    - **column index:** 2
    - **as name:** Cuffdiff
    - **input file 2:** DESeq2_Significant_DE_Genes
    - **column index file 2:** 0
    - **as name file 2:** DESeq2
    - **two or three:** three
    - **input file 3:** edgeR_Significant_DE_Genes
    - **column index file 3:** 0
    - **as name file 3:** edgeR
    - Execute

2.  View the generated Venn diagram.
    Agreement between the tools is good: the vast majority of genes identified
    as differentially expressed are agreed upon with all three programs, and
    only a handful that are exclusive to each tool.

## Optional extension: Gene set enrichment analysis

The biological question being asked in the original paper is essentially:  
*"What is the global response of the yeast transcriptome in the shift from
growth at glucose excess conditions (batch) to glucose-limited conditions
(chemostat)?"*  

We can address this question by attempting to interpret our differentially
expressed gene list at a higher level, perhaps by examining the categories of
gene and protein networks that change in response to glucose.

For example, we can input our list of differentially expressed genes to a Gene
Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis tool such as GOrilla to find out the GO
enriched terms.

NOTE: Because of time-constraints in this tutorial, the analysis was confined to
a single chromosome (chromosome I) and as a consequence we don’t have
sufficient information to look for groups of differentially expressed genes
(simply because we don’t have enough genes identified from the one chromosome to
look for statistically convincing over-representation of any particular gene
group).

1.  Download the list of genes [here in a plain-text file](https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/RNASeq_ADVNCD/EdgeR-SignificantlyExpressedGenes-columnOne.tabular)
    to your local computer by right clicking on the link and selecting Save Link As...

    Note that there are ~2500 significantly differentially expressed genes
    identified in the full analysis. Also note that the genes are ranked in
    order of statistical significance. This is critical for the next step.

2.  Explore the data using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the online
    tool GOrilla
    1.  Go to [cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il](http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/)
        - **Choose Organism:** Saccharomyces cerevisiae
        - **Choose running mode:** Single ranked list of genes
        - Open the gene list you downloaded in the previous step in a text editor.
          Select the full list, then copy and paste the list into the text box.
        - **Choose an Ontology:** Process
        - **Search Enriched GO terms**
    2.  Once the analysis has finished running, you will be redirected to a
        page depicting the GO enriched biological processes and its significance
        (indicated by colour), based on the genes you listed.
<img src="../media/rna_advanced_gene_ontology.png" height=300px>

        Scroll down to view a table of GO terms and their significance scores.
        In the last column, you can toggle the **[+] Show genes** to see the
        list of associated genes.

    3.  Experiment with different ontology categories (Function, Component) in GOrilla.


At this stage you are interpreting the experiment in different ways, potentially
discovering information that will lead you to further lab experiments. This
is driven by your biological knowledge of the problem space. There are an
unlimited number of methods for further interpretation of which GSEA is just one.
